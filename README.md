Task 2 â€“ Angular CRUD Application with Services & Routing

As part of my internship with #InternVision, I built a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Application using Angular.
This project demonstrates data handling via Angular Services, multiple routed views, form validation, and RxJS for async operations, with a fully responsive design.

Features

CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete resources (e.g., Products/Tasks)

Angular Services: Centralized data management using dependency injection

Routing: Navigate between list, create, and edit views with Angular Router

Reactive Forms: Form validation for data entry and updates

RxJS Observables: Handle asynchronous data flow efficiently

Responsive Layout: Styled with SCSS for modern, clean design
